      <p class="tutorial-paragraphs">Points are an approximate representation of the positive influence you've been to the environment while a member of E.Go.
        <br>Points are earned for many actions, as we want to reward you for anything you do to help the cause. 
        To this end, the list of things to earn points for will continuously expand as time goes on.</p>
